# Diesel-cost-estimator
I built an ML-powered Generator Diesel Cost Estimator for telecom towers. It predicts runtime using load, solar output, PHCN uptime, and temperature, then estimates daily diesel cost. Built with Streamlit, it helps operators plan, cut fuel waste, and save money across multiple sites.
