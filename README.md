Telecom towers and critical infrastructure in Nigeria often rely on generators due to unreliable grid power. Diesel is expensive, and tracking its usage is often manual, inconsistent, or reactive. I developed an intelligent Generator Diesel Cost Estimator using machine learning. It predicts generator runtime based on inputs like load, solar output, PHCN uptime, and weather and instantly estimates diesel costs per day. The tool is user-friendly built with Streamlit where you enter a few values like load (KW), solar generation, and diesel price, and it gives you an instant prediction of how long your generator will run and how much diesel it will cost. This can help tower operators and facility managers plan better, reduce fuel waste, and monitor performance more proactively potentially saving thousands of naira daily across multiple sites. With additional data from more sites, we can scale this into a full decision support system, integrating with IoT sensors and dashboards to optimize generator usage in real time.”
