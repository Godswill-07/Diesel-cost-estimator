Developed a regression-based machine learning model to predict generator runtime and diesel consumption using inputs such as solar energy output, load demand, and PHCN (grid power) uptime.
•	Achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.15 across 500 test samples, indicating a high level of accuracy in forecasting energy needs.
•	Deployed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, allowing telecom tower operators to dynamically input site parameters and obtain real-time diesel consumption forecasts.
•	Projected to reduce diesel usage by up to 15–20% per tower, translating to an average cost saving of ₦1.2M–₦1.6M annually per site (based on typical diesel usage and cost metrics).
•	Enables data-driven scheduling of generator use, minimizing unnecessary runtime and reducing operational expenditures and carbon footprint.
